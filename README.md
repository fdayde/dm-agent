# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: April 15, 2025**

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to our Instagram/Messenger DM Integration (“the Service”).  
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your personal data under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable laws.   
By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of your data as described in this Policy.  
Our Service is intended only for individuals 18 years of age or older. If you are under 18, you are not permitted to use this Service.

## 2. Who We Are

- Data Controller: Florent Daydé
- Contact: florentdayde.ei@gmail.com
- Service: A workflow system that automates handling of Instagram and Messenger direct messages (DMs), using an LLM (Large Language Model) to respond or escalate to a human.

## 3. What Data We Collect

- Direct Message (DM) Content: We collect text, images, and/or other media contained in direct messages sent via Instagram and/or Messenger.
- User Identifiers: We collect unique identifiers (e.g., Instagram or Facebook user ID, username) to route messages and generate responses.
- Technical Information: We may automatically collect data such as IP addresses, browser user-agent strings, timestamps, and logs for security and auditing.
- Metadata: We collect information regarding the timestamp and status of incoming and outgoing messages to ensure proper message handling.

## 4. Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)

Under the GDPR, we rely on the following legal bases for processing your personal data:
- Legitimate Interests: We process your data to provide an automated and/or partially automated DM handling solution, ensuring prompt replies and effective user support. We believe our interest in providing and improving the Service does not override your fundamental rights and freedoms.
- Performance of a Contract (If Applicable): Where you (or your organization) enter into a contract with us to use our Service, processing of DM content may be necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations.

## 5. How We Use Your Data

- Automated Workflow & LLM Integration: DMs are forwarded via a webhook to our workflow platform (n8n). The content is then processed by an LLM to generate replies. The LLM may decide whether a human agent is needed to respond manually.
- Response Generation: If the LLM provides a suitable automated response, it is sent to the user’s DM. If the LLM flags the message as needing human attention, authorized staff members will review and respond.
- Service Improvement: We may use aggregated or anonymized data to improve our LLM and workflow processes without identifying you personally.
- Security and Legal Obligations: We may use your data to detect, prevent, or address fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues. We may also process your data to comply with legal obligations or law enforcement requests.

## 6. Data Sharing and Transfers

- Third-Party Service Providers
  - Workflow Automation (n8n): Hosts/transfers message content in order to process and route replies.
  - LLM Provider: Processes the DM content to generate automated responses.

Where third-party providers act as Data Processors, they are contractually obliged to process data only under our instructions and in compliance with GDPR.

- International Data Transfers
If data is transferred outside the European Economic Area (EEA), we ensure an adequate level of protection by using, for example, Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or transferring only to jurisdictions deemed adequate by the European Commission.

- Business Transfers
In the event of a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your data may be transferred to a new entity in compliance with GDPR. We will provide notice if your data becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

- Legal Requirements
We may disclose data if required by law, subpoena, or to protect our legal rights and the safety of others.

## 7. Data Retention

We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy, or as required by law. Once data is no longer needed, we will securely delete or anonymize it.

## 8. Your GDPR Rights

If you are located in the EEA (or the UK under its equivalent data protection laws), you have the following rights:

- Access: You have the right to request a copy of your personal data.
- Rectification: You can ask us to correct inaccurate or incomplete personal data.
- Erasure (“Right to be Forgotten”): You can request that we delete your personal data under certain circumstances (e.g., if it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected).
- Restriction of Processing: You can request that we limit the processing of your data in certain cases.
- Data Portability: You have the right to receive your personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and to transmit it to another controller.
- Object: You can object to the processing of your personal data based on our legitimate interests.
- Withdraw Consent: Where we rely on consent as a legal basis, you have the right to withdraw it at any time without affecting the lawfulness of processing before withdrawal.

You may exercise these rights by contacting us via the details in Section 11. We will respond to valid requests within one month or as required by law.

## 9. Adults-Only Policy

Our Service is intended strictly for individuals 18 years of age or older. We do not knowingly process data from children. If you believe a child under 18 has provided us with personal data, please contact us immediately so we can remove it.

## 10. Security Measures

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data, including:
- Encrypted communication (HTTPS) for data transmissions.
- Access controls restricting who can view and process DMs.
- Periodic security reviews and software patches.

Despite these measures, no online service can guarantee absolute security. You use the Service at your own risk.

## 11. Contact Us

If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or wish to exercise your GDPR rights, please contact us at: florentdayde.ei@gmail.com

We will make every effort to address your concerns and requests in a timely and compliant manner.

## 12. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our data practices or legal obligations. If we make material changes, we will post a notice on our Service or notify you by other means. The “Last Updated” date at the top of this document indicates when the latest changes were made.
